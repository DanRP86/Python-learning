##So good you are here!! Last challenge, copy and paste this code in a notebook/pycharm (this time it's safe, I promise), or directly in Copilot. 
#Then ask to review the code to reveal the Treasure!. Once corrected, if you are one of the first you will receive a gift! :)
#Please send me the screenshot
